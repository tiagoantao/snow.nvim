# Snowvim

Snowvim is a simple Neovim plug-in to get metadata information from Snowflake.
For most cases you probably want to use [dadbod](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dadbod) and
[dadbod-ui](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-ui).
But if you want something simple and fast, this might be the plug-in for you. It also
integrates with `connections.toml`
